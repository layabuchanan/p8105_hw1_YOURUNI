This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 2

The following code loads the *“penguins”* dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## This dataset includes the variables:

  - Species
  - Island
  - Bill Length
  - Bill Depth
  - Flipper Length
  - Body Mass
  - Sex
  - Year

The penguin with the longest bill length is a Gentoo penguin from Biscoe
with a bill length of 59.6mm. The mean bill length for all of the
penguins in the dataset is 43.9219298mm. The median bill length for all
of the penguins in the dataset is 44.45mm.

The penguin with the longest flipper length is a Gentoo penguin from
Biscoe with a flipper length of 231mm. The mean flipper length for all
of the penguins in the dataset is 200.9152047mm. The median flipper
length for all of the penguins in the dataset is 197mm.

The largest penguin is a Gentoo penguin from Biscoe with a mass of
6300g. The mean mass for all penguins in the dataset is 4201.754386g.
The median mass for all penguins in the dataset is 4201.754386g.

The code chunk below generates a plot comparing the bill and flipper
lengths of the penguins in the dataset color coded by species:

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species))+geom_point(
             
           )
```

Finally, this code saves the plot as a PDF file:

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf")
```
