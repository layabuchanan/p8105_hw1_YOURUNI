This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 2

The following code loads the *“penguins”* dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## This dataset includes the variables:

  - Species
  - Island
  - Bill Length
  - Bill Depth
  - Flipper Length
  - Body Mass
  - Sex
  - Year

The penguin with the longest bill length is a Gentoo penguin from Biscoe
with a bill length of 59.6mm. The mean bill length for all of the
penguins in the dataset is `mean(penguins flipper_length_mm)`.

The code chunk below generates a plot comparing the bill and flipper
lengths of the penguins in the dataset color coded by species:

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species))+geom_point(
             
           )
```

Finally, this code saves the plot as a PDF file:

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf")
```
