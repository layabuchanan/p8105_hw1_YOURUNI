This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 1

The code below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample of 10
from a standard normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor
“levels.”

``` r
prob1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
)
```

This code takes the mean of each variable in my data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.07314379

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) 
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## [1] NA

I can take the mean of numeric and logical variables but not character
or factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) 
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp))*pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0) 
```

    ##  [1] 0.06548407 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000
    ##  [7] 0.83645885 0.00000000 0.91560596 1.34762995

# Problem 2

The following code loads the *“penguins”* dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## This dataset includes the variables:

  - Species
  - Island
  - Bill Length
  - Bill Depth
  - Flipper Length
  - Body Mass
  - Sex
  - Year

This data was collected between the years 2007 and 2009.

The penguin with the longest bill length is a Gentoo penguin from Biscoe
with a bill length of 59.6mm. The mean bill length for all of the
penguins in the dataset is 43.9219298mm with a standard deviation of
5.4595837mm.

The penguin with the longest flipper length is a Gentoo penguin from
Biscoe with a flipper length of 231mm. The mean flipper length for all
of the penguins in the dataset is 200.9152047mm with a standard
deviation of 14.0617137mm.

The largest penguin in the dataset is a Gentoo penguin from Biscoe with
a mass of 6300g. The mean mass for all penguins in the dataset is
4201.754386g with a standard deviation of 801.9545357g.

The code chunk below generates a plot comparing the bill and flipper
lengths of the penguins in the dataset color coded by species:

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species))+geom_point(
             
           )
```

![](p8105_hw1_lmb2295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Finally, this code saves the plot as a PDF file:

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf")
```
