This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105. 

# Problem 2

The following code loads the _"penguins"_ dataset. 

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset includes the variables:
----
*Species
*Island
*Bill Length
*Bill Depth
*Flipper Length
*Body Mass
*Sex
*Year

# Section 2
l
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(penguins)`.

The code chunk below creates a data frame and generates a plot.

```{r plot_example}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 2, sd = 4),
  y = 3-4.2 * x +rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y))+geom_point()
```
