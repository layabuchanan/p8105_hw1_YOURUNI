This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105. 

# Problem 2

The following code loads the _"penguins"_ dataset. 

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset includes the variables:
----
*Species
*Island
*Bill Length
*Bill Depth
*Flipper Length
*Body Mass
*Sex
*Year

# Section 2
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `mean(penguins[["flipper_length_mm"]])`.

The code chunk below creates a data frame and generates a plot.

```{r plot_example}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species))+geom_point()

```
