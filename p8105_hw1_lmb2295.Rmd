This is my submission for the first homework assignment for P8105. 

# Problem 2

The following code loads the _"penguins"_ dataset. 

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset includes the variables:
--------
*   Species
*   Island
*   Bill Length
*   Bill Depth
*   Flipper Length
*   Body Mass
*   Sex
*   Year

# Section 2
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `mean(penguins[["flipper_length_mm"]])`.

The code chunk below generates a plot comparing the bill and flipper lengths of the penguins in the dataset, then, it saves the plot as a pdf file.

```{r plot_example}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species))+geom_point()


ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf")

```
